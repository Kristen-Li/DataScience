    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first project of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program which is composed by:\n",
    "- Supervised Learning\n",
    "- Deep Learning\n",
    "- Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to put in action all the information provided during the Supervised Learning part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought us on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Our goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize our goal is to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census in order to predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. \n",
    "This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the [article](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf) _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software and Libraries\n",
    "This project uses Python 3.6.0 the following libraries:\n",
    "- NumPy\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- scikit-learn\n",
    "- Matplotlib\n",
    "- seaborn"

    "Run the code cell below to load necessary Python libraries and load the census data. Note that the last column from this dataset, `'income'`, will be our target label (whether an individual makes more than, or at most, $50,000 annually). All other columns are features about each individual in the census database."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam (including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average (harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score (we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios).\n",

    "#### Naive Predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "The the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",
    "As already said looking at the distribution of the data it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. Therefore a model that always predicts `'1'` (i.e. the individual makes more than 50k) will generally be right. It is also intresting to note that the naive predictor will have no **True Negatives (TN)** or **False Negatives (FN)** as we are not making any negative (`'0'` value) predictions. \n",
    "Moreover **Accuracy** in this case becomes the same as our **Precision** as every prediction that we have made with value `'1'` that should have `'0'` becomes a **False Positive (FP)** and **Recall** will becomes 1 as we have no **False Negatives (FN)**."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated by [`scikit-learn documentation`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html) choosing the right estimator fo the assigned task can be very difficult. As said in this [`Quora article`](https://www.quora.com/What-do-experienced-data-scientists-think-of-Scikit-Learns-flowchart-to-choose-the-right-estimator) there is not an exact formula to do it but the only way is to try and evaluate the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "  A [`decision tree`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) is a decision support tool that uses flowchart-like structure for decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Real-world application: decision trees and, in general, CART (Classification and Regression Trees) are often used in    financial analysis and recommendation systems. For example in recommendation systems they are used to recommend relevant content to users exploiting their data and feedbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Strengths:\n",
    "   - Simple to understand and interpret by humans.\n",
    "   - Able to work with numerical and categorical.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Weaknesses:\n",
    "   - Decision Trees can be very non-robust. A small change in the training data can result in a large change in the tree and consequently the final predictions.\n",
    "   - It can create over-complex trees that do not generalize well from the training data.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Motivation to choose it: it can handle both numerical and categorical data even if the pre-processing steps we have done might already mitigate whatever advantage we would have had.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "  [`SVM`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine) given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, the SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Real-world application: SVM are used a lot in image classification and image segmentation. For example: Face detection or object detection.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Strengths:\n",
    "   - Effective in high dimensional spaces, or when there are a lot of features.\n",
    "   - Capable of defining complex higher order separation planes through custom kernels.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Weaknesses:\n",
    "   - Requires full labeling of input data.\n",
    "   - Directly applicable only for two-class tasks.\n",
    "   - Time consuming on large datasets.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Motivation to choose it: SVM is a good candidate for our task because we have not to much data (`<100K samples`) in fact SVC can be slow to train on large dataset and also because we are dealing with a two-class task (The 'income' feature we want to predict has only two possible categories (<=50K and >50K) we can apply SVM directly.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "- Ensemble Methods: AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "  [`AdaBoost`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost), short for Adaptive Boosting, is a machine learning meta-algorithm that can be used in conjunction with many other types of learning algorithms to improve performance. The output of the other learning algorithms called 'weak learners' (e.g. decision trees) is combined into a weighted sum that represents the final output of the boosted classifier. AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent weak learners are tweaked in favor of those instances misclassified by previous classifiers. The individual learners can be weak, but as long as the performance of each one is slightly better than random guessing, the final model can be proven to converge to a strong learner.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Real-world application: It is extensively used in object detection.\n",
    "   \n",
    " - Strengths:\n",
    "   - Ensemble methods, including Adaboost are more robust than single estimators, have improved generalizability.\n",
    "   - Robust to overfitting.\n",
    "  \n",
    " - Weaknesses:\n",
    "   - Sensitive to noisy data and outliers.\n",
    "   - If the weak learners are biased also the resulting boosted model will be biased.\n",
    "  \n",
    " - Motivation to choose it: in general ensemble methods are high quality classifiers because they combine many weak classifier for final prediction. AdaBoost can learn non-linear decision boundaries and is pretty fast to train."

    "**Answer:** Looking at the graph at the bottom left from the cell above (the visualization created by `vs.evaluate(results, accuracy, fscore)`) and also in the detailed results cell we can see that AdaBoost outperfoms both the decision tree and SVC for F-score and accuracy for the testing set. We can also see that the decision tree overfit the training dataset so it performs poorly on the testing set. For the point of view of the prediction/training time the decision tree is the fastest and the SVM is by far the slowest. This is motivated by the fact that by default, [`AdaBoostClassifier`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier.html) uses `DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth = 1)` as its weak learners, which can handle categorical and numerical data and are relatively faster to train. To confirm that AdaBoost is the model with the best performance we can also compare its confusion matrix with the confusion matrix of the other models.  "

    "**Answer:** Given the hypothesis that a person earnig more than \\$50,000 per year is more likely a potential new donor for *CharityML* we have trained a model with the census information of individuals that can predict if a person makes  more than \\$50,000 per year. In this way we can use this prediction to understand if it is a good idea to contact a new potential donor beacause he will likely donate to the charity. The model with the best performances in the ones selected is Adaboost, which is an ensemble model, thus it is based on the idea that combining simple models called \"weak learners\" (i.e. letting them vote for the final answer) we can build a more complex one. The algorithm strat by fitting a classifier on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the classifier on the same dataset but where the weights of incorrectly classified instances are adjusted such that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases. The training iteration are repeated for a number of iterations defined by the user in an attempt to find the set of weighted hypotheses that combined will perform best on the data. The cool thing about Adaboost is that is fast to train because we can use \"weak learners\" which perform slightly better than random guessing and obtain a final model with very good perfomances."

Accuracy is 3% lower and F-score is 6% lower but reasonably training on less data means that also the training time is lower. We can conclude that if the training time is a discriminating factor  using only the most important features could be a solution to the problem because it is faster and does not have a big impact on the predictive performances. Also notice if we use only 10% of the training sample, both Accuracy and F-score does not change much. It's another option to consider. "
